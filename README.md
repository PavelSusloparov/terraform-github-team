# terraform-github-team

A [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) 0.12 that offers a more convenient and tested way to provision and manage
[GitHub teams](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/organizing-members-into-teams).

> This Module uses `for, for-each and dynamic nested blocks` that were introduced in Terraform 0.12.
> A common problem in Terraform configurations for versions 0.11 and earlier is dealing with situations where the number
> of values or resources is decided by a dynamic expression rather than a fixed count.
> You can now dynamically add and remove items from and to Lists without the necessity to render the whole list of
> resources again. Terraform will only add and remove the items you want it to.

  version = "0.0.1"

  name        = "DevOps"
  description = "The DevOps Team"
  privacy     = "secret"

  members = [
    "a-user",
    "b-user"
  ]

  maintainers = [
    "a-maintainer"
  ]

  push_repositories = [
    github_repository.repository.name,
  ]
}

resource "github_repository" "repository" {
  name   = "a-repository"
}
```

## Examples

For a complete example please see [examples](https://github.com/mineiros-io/terraform-github-team/tree/master/examples) directory.

that offers targets to execute the hooks and tests.

**Execute all pre-commit hooks with Docker:**

```bash
make docker/pre-commit-hooks
```

**Execute the Unit Test (deploy und undeploy the example):**

Please be aware, that in order to run the test you must provide GitHub credentials and an organization.
Running the tests will create and destroy real resources.

```bash
GITHUB_ORGANIZATION=YOUR_GITHUB_ORGANIZATION \
GITHUB_TOKEN=YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN \

```

## Module Versioning

This Module follows the principles of [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/).

Using the given version number of `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, we apply the following constructs:

1. Use the `MAJOR` version for incompatible changes.
1. Use the `MINOR` version when adding functionality in a backwards compatible manner.
1. Use the `PATCH` version when introducing backwards compatible bug fixes.

### Backwards compatibility in `0.0.z` and `0.y.z` version

- In the context of initial development, backwards compatibility in versions `0.0.z` is **not guaranteed** when `z` is
  increased. (Initial development)
- In the context of pre-release, backwards compatibility in versions `0.y.z` is **not guaranteed** when `y` is
  increased. (Pre-release)
